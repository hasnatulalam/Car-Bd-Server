## Live Link: Visit our site  [Doggo](https://doggo-a0392.web.app/)


### About Project 
   - This is a niche site for influencing people to buy various kinda foods for their dogs. User's can signup/login here and buy neccessary goods from the site. I've implemented admin panel too. Not but the list, this task was given by Programming hero as the final assignment.


#### Technolgy I've Used: 
- Users will see their dashboard and admin will see admin dashboard differently.
- I created some api's here to fetch data from database
- I used mongodb as database
- express is used here to make the task easier.
- I also have used cors to ignore warning
- I placed my database info in a env file and that's how I kept it secret
